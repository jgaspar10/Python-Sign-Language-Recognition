# Project Title: Sign Language Recognition System

# Description:

This project is focused on developing a Sign Language recognition system using the PYTHON programming language. The system utilizes a variety of tools and libraries including MediaPipe Holistic, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Sklearn, OpenCV, and an LSTM network model to accurately recognize hand gestures captured through a web camera and translate them to the corresponding text on the screen.

# Features:

- Utilizes MediaPipe Holistic, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Sklearn, OpenCV, and LSTM network model
- Accurately recognizes hand gestures captured via web camera
- Translates hand gestures to corresponding text on the screen

# Dependencies:

- MediaPipe Holistic
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Sklearn
- OpenCV

# Usage:

To run the project, you need to have all the required dependencies installed, then you can use your command line and type python main.py
You need to have a web camera to use this system

# Future Work:

Incorporating more functionalities like providing more languages support, providing a voice detection feature, text to sign language translation, and increase the accuracy.
